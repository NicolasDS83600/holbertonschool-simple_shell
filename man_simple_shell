.TH HSH 1 "9 Janvier 2026" "1.0" "Holberton Simple Shell"
.SH NAME
hsh \- simple UNIX command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
A simple command-line interpreter written in C. It reads commands inputs and executes them.
It supports both interactive and non-interactive modes.

.SH MODES OF OPERATION
.TP
.B Interactive mode
Runs when standard input is connected to a terminal. The shell displays the prompt:
.PP
($)
and waits for user input.

Example:
.pp
($) ls -l
($) echo Hello World

.TP
.B Non-interactive mode
Runs when input is redirected or piped into the shell. Commands are executed sequentially without printing a prompt.

Example:
.PP
$ echo "ls" | hsh
$ echo "ls -l" | ./hsh

.SH BUILT-IN IN COMMANDS
.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell. This command don't take arguments and returns the exit status of the last executed command.

.TP
.B env
Display the current environment variables, one per line, in the following format:
.I name=value.

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION

The simple command-line interpreter executes commands by the following logic :

.B hsh
executes commands by first checking if the command contains a '/' character; if so, it is treated as a file path. Otherwise, the shell searches for the executable in the directories listed in the
.B PATH
environment variable. When found, the shell creates a new process with
.B fork (2)
and runs the command in the child process using
.B execve (2), 
while the parent waits for the child to finish with
.B waitpid (2). 
The shell stores and returns the exit status of the last executed command.

.SH EXAMPLES
Interactive mode:
.EX
$ ./hsh
($) echo "Holberton"
Holberton
($) exit
$
.EE

Non-interactive mode:
.EX
$ echo "ls" | ./hsh
file1.txt  file2.txt  script.sh  docs  images
$
.EE

.SH RETURN VALUES
.B hsh
returns the exit status of the last command executed.

The following exit codes are used:
.TP
.B 0
Successful execution.
.TP
.B 1
General error.
.TP
.B 126
Command found but not executable.
.TP
.B 127
Command not found.

.SH ERROR MESSAGES
Error messages are printed to
.B stderr
following this format:

.PP
.nf
hsh: line_number: command: error_message
.fi

Examples:

.PP
.nf
hsh: 3: aaa: not found
hsh: 4: ./dir: Permission denied
.fi

.PP
